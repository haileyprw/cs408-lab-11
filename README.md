# M11.2 Lab

## Overview

This lab was the culmination of everything we have learned put together. We allowed CORS in the AWS backend
and linked that together with HTML and CSS to make a simple inventory app. You can add, load, or delete items
using the app.

## Getting Started

This app can be ran by cloning the github repository and running live preview in the browser.
